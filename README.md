# AoC-2022

This repository contains AoC-2022 solutions.Code may not be fully optimized but contains the basic thought process for solving and I will try to refactor as I learn new things.

### Day6-Sliding Window
I solved it through bruteforce approach but after going through reddit I found out we can solve this through sliding window

I need to learn more about sliding window and its use cases

### Day7-Tree Data structure and Recursion
I have never implemented tree and I was very happy after I solved it

Even though the solution is not that elegant it still works

I need to learn more about trees and recursion 


### Day8 - 2D grid(we need to play with max and length of row/column)
I implemented it as a custom Dictionary of (x,y)->p

Dont know if it the efficient way to do it but it works

Part1 solved 

Part2,I was unable to solve and will try to solve it once I am free 


### Day9 - 2D grid and something related to cellular automata

I am  unable to solve it . I will play with cellular automata and try to solve

### Day10 - CRT(2D) grid

This is easy compared to previous days and my solution is somewhat messy.I will try to refactor.

### Day 11 
 
 Not solved for now but will solve once I get time
